# Steam Launch Helper 

A small static web tool to build Steam launch options — combine flags and Proton/DXVK environment variables and get a ready-to-copy launch options string.

---

## Quick start

- Serve locally: `python -m http.server 8000` (or use VS Code Live Server)
- Open: `http://localhost:8000/`
- Click categories to expand flags, enter values where required, and copy the resulting launch options with **Copy to Clipboard**.

---

## How it works

- `steam.json` defines categories and flag objects (fields: `flag`, `type`, `label`, `description`).
- `script.js` loads `steam.json`, renders the UI, and `updateOutput()` builds the final string.
- Flags under the **Proton & DXVK** category are treated as environment variables and placed before `%command%` (e.g. `DXVK_HUD="fps,memory" %command%`).

---

## Add or edit flags

Each flag in `steam.json` looks like:

```json
{
  "flag": "DXVK_HUD",
  "type": "text",
  "label": "DXVK HUD",
  "description": "Enable DXVK HUD overlay (comma-separated list: fps,memory,version,api)."
}
```

- `flag`: exact flag or env var name used in the final output
- `type`: `boolean` (checkbox), `text`, or `number`
- `label` / `description`: shown in the UI

IDs for inputs are generated by sanitizing `category + flag`. Avoid duplicate flags or conflicting names to prevent id collisions.

## Accessibility & UX

- Categories are keyboard-accessible (use Enter/Space to toggle).
- Focus outlines are visible for keyboard navigation.
- Live status messages are provided for actions like copy-to-clipboard.

---

## Development

- This is a static site — no build step required. Serve with any static server.
- Main files:
  - `index.html` — UI shell
  - `script.js` — loads `steam.json` and handles UI/interactions
  - `steam.json` — list of categories and flags
  - `styles.css` — styles

If you make changes to `steam.json`, reload the page to see them reflected.

Contributions welcome — open a PR with:
- New flags or categories added to `steam.json`
